- This is the first prototype of the Hack-The-Crisis Hackathon project.
- It's purpose is to gather data nation wide from multiple hospitals regarding the patients which have the covid-19 virus.
- After sufficient data is gathered, a meeting with doctors, scientists and data analysts should be held in order to create a prediction system for future cases. These predicitons will contain data regarding the evolution of a patient, the outcome, sugestions to improve ones health and additionaly what treatment should be implemented for a patient.
- In the time following the meeting, the system should be implemented inside the web application.
